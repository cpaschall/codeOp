## Description

---

This full-stack application is built from scratch using the Model View Controller (MVC) paradigm to connect a server-side API, user authentication, and a database. The application is called **codeOp**, which is a play on code and co-op. A number of nonprofits lack a development team and there are plenty of budding developers in need of real-world experience and seasoned ones who are happy to share their expertise. This site is designed to provide a space where they can share resources, gain real-world experience, and complete projects.
