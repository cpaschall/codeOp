# codeOp

This application is a place for budding developers, experienced developers, and companies to come together to exchange their ideas and skills. (1)Non-profit companies lacking a team of web developers can post their project, including specific goals. (2) Programmers with creative project ideas looking for help can also pitch project ideas. (3) In response, developers seeking to gain experience/seasoned developers looking to simply volunteer can sign up to help.

Users will be able to create profiles with their contact info (full name/ email address), specify their goals (fulfill project or gain experience), list existing and/or desired experience (programming language/frameworks). When goals and skills match up, users can contact one another in the comment fields or via email to express interest.
